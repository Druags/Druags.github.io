      This summer I was at sea for the first time, my dream came true.

      We went with the whole family for ten days in Sochi. By the sea I found
      beautiful shells.

      In Sochi we went to the zoo and there I saw a turtle.

      I spent the rest of the holidays at my grandmother's dacha, picking
      strawberries.
